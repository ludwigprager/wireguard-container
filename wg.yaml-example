# AllowedIPs in Server Configuration:
# - Specifies which IP addresses are allowed to connect to the server.
# - Typically, you would set this to the subnet of the VPN (e.g., 10.0.0.0/24), allowing all peers within this range to communicate through the server.

# Peer Configuration
# - Defines which IP addresses the peer can communicate with through the VPN tunnel.
# - This setting can include:
#   -Specific IP addresses (e.g., 10.0.0.2).
#   -Subnets (e.g., 10.0.0.0/24), allowing the peer to access all addresses within that subnet.
#   -0.0.0.0/0 to route all traffic through the VPN, effectively making the peer's internet traffic go through the server.
